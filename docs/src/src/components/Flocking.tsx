                The flocking algorithm mimics behaviors commonly seen in nature.
                A typical example of this behavior is the flight of birds in a
                flock. In this post, I'd like to go through the intricacies of
                the implementation both on CPU and GPU using compute shaders,

            <h2>So, what is the Flocking Algorithm?</h2>
            <p id="reference">
                The flocking algorithm was first presented in 1987 by{" "}
                <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Craig Reynolds</a>{" "}
                [1, 2]. From the very beginning, the goal was to mimic behavior
                commonly seen in nature - the flight of birds in the sky or
                movement of fish in the sea. When we look at the algorithmic
                steering behaviors, we usually expect some kind of centralized
                guidance. Some of the older algorithms trying to simulate the
                flocking behavior relied on the centralized approach; however,
                the centralized approach increases the overall complexity, and,
                what is most significant, the simulation lacks natural
                appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contrary to the centralized approach, Raynold's flocking
                algorithm models the behavior of each agent individually. These
                agents representing the birds or fish are also commonly referred
                to as boids. To some extent, the system of boids can be
                understood as a particle system. The original paper goes further
                into the differences between boids and particles, but it isn't
                really that relevant here. The sketch bellow is just a 2D
                illustration.

                Illustration of the flocking algorithm in 2D with additional
                mechanics. Each boid has a unique DNA describing its speed

                of the boid - <span className="orange">orange</span> means
                happy, <span className="blue">blue</span> means depressed and{" "}
                <span className="pink">pink-ish white</span> is neutral. Boids
                can become depressed when they are too far or too close to other
                boids, they become unhappy when they are hungry, and some of
                them have a "genetic" disposition to be happier than others.

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                The minimal example boid consists of three vectors - position,
                velocity, and acceleration. Each boid looks around and adjusts
                its settings according to the boids within a specific range. The
                adjustments are made according to four basic rules. The original
                paper introduced only three of them and you can find the fourth
                one in [3, 4]. The final four rules are alignment, separation,
                cohesion, and clarity of view.

            <dl className="post">
                <dt>Alignment</dt>
                <dd>
                    The rule of alignment takes the directions of all boids
                    within a particular range and computes the average
                    direction. This new direction is represented as a force
                    vector, which is applied to the current velocity of the
                    boid.
                </dd>
                <dt>Separation</dt>
                <dd>
                    The second rule, separation, steers the boid to avoid
                    crowding local flockmates. The force vector is obtained as
                    the sum of all inverse direction vectors between the local
                    boids.
                </dd>
                <dt>Cohesion</dt>
                <dd>
                    The third rule, cohesion, ensures the boids stay relatively
                    close to each other by steering toward the average position
                    of local flockmates.
                </dd>
                <dt>Clarity of view</dt>
                <dd>
                    The last rule takes into account the view field and
                    navigates the boid to keep its view field clear.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                All four rules are depicted in the picture above. In the end, we
                can add all four forces together, and the result corresponds to
                the boid's current acceleration. It is also quite common to
                limit the amount of force by clamping the length of each force
                vector by some constant. On the other hand, it is possible to
                increase the amount of force applied during each iteration by a
                different factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is quite interesting to realize how many configurable parts
                there are in the algorithm. There is the flocking radius,
                followed by the maximum amount of force and amplification
                factor. The size of the desired unobstructed view field can also
                be configurable.{" "}

            <h2>Circles</h2>
            <p>
                I found a very nice thing - with a very small change, you can
                force the boids to form circles! I haven't been able to find any
                mention of this in any literature, but you can do this just by
                changing the shape of the flocking area (flocking area meaning
                the area visible to each boid). The example bellow uses a
                half-hemisphere oriented in the positive z-direction.
            </p>
            <div className="imageGrid">

            </p>
            <p>
                The boids inside the aproximate half-hemisphere can be easily
                filtered using the grid-based approach, where you just ignore
                the boids inside cells "behind" the current boid. You can really
                start to see the circles around 0:20.

            <p className="figureDescription">Boids forming circles</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The most straightforward approach would be:</p>
            {/* prettier-ignore */}
            <pre>
                <span>for each boid as b:</span>
                <span>    for each boid as e:</span>
                <span>        if (e is in the flocking range of b) and (e is not b):</span>
                <span>            accumulate forces from e to b</span>
                <span>for each boid as b:</span>
                <span>    apply accumulated forces to b</span>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The obvious downfall of this approach is its quadratic
                complexity. The number of performed tests grows really fast, a
                single update of thousand boids requires millions of tests (
                <span className="math">line&nbsp;3</span> in the code above).
            </p>
            <p>
                A better approach would be to parallelize the calculation (using
                CPU threads), but that would improve the performance only by a
                factor of thread count. In reality, only the closer boids have a
                higher chance of falling into the flocking range; therefore,
                most of the tests yield a negative result. An alternative
                approach - more relevant than a parallelization - is to organize
                the boids into a spatial data structure, e.g., octree.
            </p>
            <h3>Optimizing Flocking with Octree</h3>
            <p>
                The octree reduces the complexity of the algorithm close to{" "}
                <span className="math">n&nbsp;log(n)</span>, which is, to some
                extent, feasible. The pitfall of this approach is the necessity
                to reconstruct the structure each frame. It is possible to
                simply swap the data inside the tree; however, when the amount
                of changes reaches a critical limit, the tree becomes very
                unbalanced. It is just simpler to build the entire data
                structure from scratch.

            <p>
                Nevertheless, since we really want to make the algorithm faster,{" "}
                <span className="math">n&nbsp;log(n)</span> won't cut it, the
                main bottleneck is still the sheer amount of computations
                performed during the update. This is where the GPU comes into
                play.
            </p>
            <h3>Parallel Computation</h3>
            <p>
                To some extent, flocking could surely be listed as one of{" "}
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">
                    the embarrassingly parallel problems
                </a>
                . If we had a computer that could run as many threads as the
                number of boids in parallel, each thread could calculate the
                acceleration of the assigned boid independently. But hold on,
                this can be effectively done using the GPU! Each GPU thread can
                simulate a single boid:

            <p>
                However, this approach solves only half of the problem. GPUs use
                SIMD or, more precisely,{" "}
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_threads">
                    SIMT execution model
                </a>
                , which allows for large amounts of data - boids in this case -
                to be processed in parallel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The remaining issue here is the small number of boids which will
                fall into the flocking range. Checking all combinations of boids
                with a brute force approach can always be improved by organizing
                the boids into a spatial structure, enabling quick elimination
                of distant boids.

            <h3>Grid-based Flocking</h3>
            <p>
                To further improve the efficiency of the algorithm, I considered
                two options:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>sorting according to a single axis projection,</li>
                <li>or organizing boids into a uniform 3D grid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both of these approaches are quite similar:</p>
            {/* prettier-ignore */}

                <span>    my_boid = boid[thread_id]</span>
                <span>    my_boid.cell = compute which cell my_boid belongs to</span>

                <span></span>
                <span>inside each thread:</span>
                <span>    my_boid = boid[thread_id]</span>
                <span>    for each "relevant cell" as c:</span>
                <span></span>
                <span>        #the boids in each cell can be accessed quickly</span>
                <span>        #since the boids are sorted according to their current cell id</span>
                <span></span>
                <span>        for each boid in c as b:</span>
                <span>            if (b is in the flocking range of my_boid) and (b is not my_boid):</span>
                <span>                accumulate forces from b</span>

                <span>sync all threads</span>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can pick x, y, or z coordinate as{" "}
                <span className="math">my_boid.cell</span>, the cells are going
                to represent long blocks spanning over the remaining dimensions.
                This approach always produces more candidates, which is visible
                in the image bellow. On the other hand, uniform grid takes into
                account all three spatial coordinates and will likely provide
                better results.
            </p>

            <div className="imageGrid">
                <img
                    src={imgCandidates}
                    alt="candidates"
                    style={{
                        background: "#EEE",
                        filter: "invert(1) brightness(1.5)",
                    }}
                />
            </div>

            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, the organization into a grid involves
                sorting the boids. To maximize the performance, the sorting
                should take place on the GPU as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we use the 3D uniform grid, the flocking candidates are
                located inside the twenty-seven cells containing and surrounding
                the current boid (in 2D it's only nine). The size of the cell
                should be set up, so that the cell sides are half the size of
                the flocking radius. This ensures that the lookup for all
                positions within the local cell would return all of the boids
                within the range, provided we traverse the local and twenty-six
                surrounding cells.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to use OpenGL for drawing the boids and bounding boxes
                and OpenGL Compute shaders for the implementation of the
                parallel computations. I have tested all the mentioned
                approaches, except for the single-axis projection. That approach
                seemed similar to the one utilizing a grid, except less
                efficient, thus not worth implementing.
            </p>
            <h3>Bugs and Pitfalls</h3>
            <p>
                I got stuck several times during the implementation - however,
                the most significant pitfall regarded the memory alignment of
                data in compute shaders. When the data is transfered from the
                CPU to the GPU, the Bytes are copied{" "}
                <span className="it">as is</span> and there is no padding
                involved. However, the internal type in GLSL{" "}
                <span className="math">vec3</span> - type useful for vector
                representation - is always 16-Bytes-aligned.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means each two <span className="math">vec3</span> next to
                each other would have a 4-Byte padding between them. However,
                the data copied from the CPU is tightly packed, and to utilize
                these types in data layout specification requires manually
                padding each vector with any 4-Byte type.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two fixes available - to add the desired padding or to
                just simply work with <span className="math">float[3]</span>{" "}
                arrays instead of vectors. The obvious choice would normally be
                the first approach. However, then I discovered{" "}
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38172696/should-i-ever-use-a-vec3-inside-of-a-uniform-buffer-or-shader-storage-buffer-o">
                    this thread [5]
                </a>
                , which mentions that the support for the manual padding is
                rather fuzzy, and the use of vector variables should be avoided.
                So, I went with <span className="math">float[3]</span> instead.
            </p>
            <h3>What I actually made</h3>
            <p>
                I made an{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/vojtatom/flocking-cpp">
                    OpenGL app (github repo)
                </a>
                . The app is configurable by changing the parameters in the
                environment file (see <span className="math">env.txt</span>).
                Also, Doxygen documentation is attached to the project. There
                are four mutations of the implementation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CPU naive</li>
                <li>CPU octree-based</li>
                <li>GPU brute-force</li>
                <li>GPU regular grid</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each version is encapsulated in a single simulation engine
                class. The first two classes are pure CPU implementations of the
                flocking algorithm, and the last two utilize Compute shaders.
            </p>
            <h3>CPU naive and octree implementation</h3>
            <p>
                The naive CPU implementation is rather uninteresting, and it
                could be improved in so many ways, e.g., with the use of SSE
                instructions and threads. The enhanced CPU engine utilizes
                octree. An interesting detail about the octree is the
                implementation optimized for faster reconstruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each frame, the tree is constructed from scratch. Therefore, it
                is necessary to avoid reallocation of the tree nodes at all
                costs. Each tree node is supposed to have eight child nodes;
                however, some of those nodes could easily stay uninhabited.
                There is no point in even constructing such nodes. The tree
                works with a buffer of reusable nodes, and all used values are
                tightly packed.
            </p>
            <h3>GPU brute-force implementation</h3>
            <p>
                The naive GPU implementation processes one boid per invocation.
                Each invocation picks a boid and then linearly iterates through
                all other boids. The nice thing about this approach is its
                simplicity; there is no sorting involved. The unfortunate thing
                is the need to read from global memory. It would be possible to
                copy a chunk of boids from the global memory into the local
                shared memory first; however, that has been left as a possible
                improvement for future version.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main advantage of the naive GPU implementation can be
                demonstrated when compared with the CPU octree implementation
                with high densities of boids in isolated locations. These
                centers cause the tree range queries to stall. The performance
                of the octree in this situation is almost equivalent to the
                performance of the naive CPU implementation with the added cost
                of tree traversal. The naive GPU implementation can eliminate
                the cost of sequentially repeated range search for each boid.
            </p>
            <h3>GPU grid-based implementation</h3>
            <p>
                The core idea behind this version is to combine the speedups
                gained by parallelization while providing a faster way to
                perform range queries by sorting the data according to a
                particular grid.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
                One technical detial worth mentioning is the implementation of
                the bitonic merge sort. The implementation is designed to
                utilize all dispatched invocations and to maximize the benefit
                of using shared memory inside the local workgroup (and also
                minimize the number of global sync points) (basically it's
                cool). Look at the source code for more info.
            </p>
            <h2>Benchmarks</h2>
            <p>
                Out of curiosity I tested the implementation on two computers;
                the goal was to measure the computation time of a single frame.
                According to expectation, the GPU implementation beat the
                sequential CPU implementation by orders of magnitude. It was not
                possible to measure some data samples on both GPU and CPU purely
                because of the CPU implementation performance.

                The benchmark used diferent sizes of the flocking area (box size
                is noted in the graphs, it is scaled according to the number of
                boids). Used parameters are flocking radius 20, force limit 0.1,
                and speed limit 2.0. The CPU octree and GPU grid-based versions
                are density-sensitive, meaning that the speed of execution is
                also limited by the spatial density of the boids.
