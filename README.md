# Flocking

The flocking algorithm mimics behaviors commonly seen in nature. A typical example of this behavior is the flight of birds in a flock. This repo contains C++ implementation both for CPU and GPU using compute shaders.
Implementation includes:

- CPU naive
- CPU octree-based
- GPU brute-force
- GPU regular grid

## Outputs

I made a [blogpost describing the design, there are also some outputs, see more here!](https://vojtatom.github.io/flocking)
